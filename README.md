# Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built using React and the **redux-state-handler** library for state management. The app allows users to create, complete, and delete todos while demonstrating the power and ease of use of the redux-state-handler.

## Introduction

**Redux State Handler** is a lightweight and efficient library that simplifies state management in React applications. It provides a centralized store for managing application state, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their state management practices.

Key features of the **redux-state-handler** library include:

- **`getState()`**: A method that allows you to retrieve the current state from the centralized store, ensuring your components always have access to the latest state values.

- **`setState()`**: A method for updating the state. You can pass either a new state value or a callback function that receives the current state. This flexibility is vital for making state changes based on previous values, fostering a reactive user interface.

By leveraging these methods, you can build responsive applications with minimal boilerplate code. The library is designed to enhance your productivity and streamline state management, making it easier to focus on building your app.
